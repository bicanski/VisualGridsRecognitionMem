This repo contains the code for my model of visual recogntion memory (Bicanski and Burgess 2019, Current Biology).

Bicanski A, Burgess N. - A computational model of recognition memory via grid cells. Current Biology, 2019, 29, 1â€“12. DOI: 10.1016/j.cub.2019.01.077

The code provided comes with no warranty etc. and you use it at your own risk. 
Furthermore it is licenced under the GPL. You are free to re-use and copy the 
code, but attribution must be correctly given.

I have tried focus on readbilty, not conciseness and/or efficiency. The code runs even on modest hardware as it 
is. I have done my best to use self-explanatory variable names and to annotate the code. 
If something remains cryptic I will happily assist. Please do not hesitate to contact me.
